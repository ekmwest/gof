## Learning Trick #1 — Visual Associations

Memorizing flags is fun, but sometimes difficult.

One powerful trick is to create a visual association between the flag and its country name. This association doesn't have to make sense to anyone but you, as long as you come up with your own association. Examples:

- The triangles in the flag of **East Timor** looks like a compass pointing towards **east**.
- The moon in the flag of **Singapore** looks like it's **sing**ing — and the stars looks like music notes.
- The red band in the flag of **Central African Republic** is positioned at the **center** of the flag.

If you have troubles memorizing a flag, spend a few minutes studying the flag and try to find a visual association between the flag and its country name. Once you've found an association, the flag will be easy to remember!



## Learning Trick #2 — One Continent at a Time

Another trick is to learn one continent at a time:

- Navigate to [countries.ekmwest.io](https://countries.ekmwest.io/)</a>.
- Check the **Hide Country Names** checkbox.
- Search for *Europe*, *Asia*, or any other continent.
- Now you'll see the flags for that continent, without the country names.
- Look at a flag and guess its country name.
- Click the flag to reveal its name.
- Click the back-button in your browser to go back.
